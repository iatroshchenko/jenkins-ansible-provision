## To provision ansible server
- make sure all example files are renamed (or copied) and are the actual files playbooks need to be executed
- run "make provision"
- run "make authorize" to authorize deploy user with your ssh key
- it's a good practice to use deploy user, so update .env with USER=deploy, but it's optional
